Got it — here’s the full task menu we’ve been working from, reconstructed from our progress so far.
I’ve organized it into main features (A, B, C…) and sub-steps (.1, .2…) so we can easily pick and choose.

⸻

A — Fixtures (Series, Teams, Players)

A1 — Series
	•	A1.1 Create SeriesDto + any create/update request DTOs
	•	A1.2 Create commands (Create, Update, Delete)
	•	A1.3 Create queries (GetById, Search, List)
	•	A1.4 Add validators for commands
	•	A1.5 Implement MediatR handlers
	•	A1.6 Add mappings in AutoMapper profile
	•	A1.7 Create controller endpoints & wire to handlers
	•	A1.8 Add unit & integration tests for Series feature

A2 — Teams
	•	A2.1 Create RealTeamDto + request DTOs
	•	A2.2 Create commands (Create, Update, Delete)
	•	A2.3 Create queries (GetById, Search, List by Series)
	•	A2.4 Add validators for commands
	•	A2.5 Implement MediatR handlers
	•	A2.6 Add mappings in AutoMapper profile
	•	A2.7 Create controller endpoints & wire to handlers
	•	A2.8 Add unit & integration tests for Teams feature

A3 — Players
	•	A3.1 Create PlayerDto + request DTOs
	•	A3.2 Create commands (Create, Update, Delete)
	•	A3.3 Create queries (GetById, Search, List by Team)
	•	A3.4 Add validators for commands
	•	A3.5 Implement MediatR handlers
	•	A3.6 Add mappings in AutoMapper profile
	•	A3.7 Create controller endpoints & wire to handlers
	•	A3.8 Add unit & integration tests for Players feature

⸻

B — Matches & Scores
	•	B1 Match DTOs + commands/queries/handlers/mappings/controllers/tests
	•	B2 Score DTOs + commands/queries/handlers/mappings/controllers/tests

⸻

C — Pagination & Search Enhancements
	•	C1 Create generic PaginatedResult<T>
	•	C2 Integrate with all search/list endpoints
	•	C3 Update test cases for pagination

⸻

D — Infrastructure & Common
	•	D1 Configure snake_case naming in EF Core
	•	D2 Register and use interceptors for Created*/Modified*/Soft Delete
	•	D3 Database migration folders per DbContext
	•	D4 Health check endpoint & diagnostics

⸻

E — Tests
	•	E1 Unit tests for Application layer
	•	E2 Integration tests with WebApplicationFactory
	•	E3 .http files for local smoke tests (dev only)

⸻

Do you want me to mark which of these are already completed so we can focus only on pending ones?
That way we’ll have a clean “current state” menu to pick from.
